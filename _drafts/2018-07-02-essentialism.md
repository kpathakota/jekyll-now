## Essentialism
by Greg Mckeown

This blog was conceived while reading this book. Perhaps conceived is too strong a word. I'd like to think of this blog as a direct decendent of the book. Or rather, it tries to be. At the very least, they share similar names so there is that. 

I rather like the steps Greg lays out to the essential lifestyle: 
1. Explore
1. Eliminate
1. Execute

These 3 steps all start with the letter 'E'. Coincidentally, the book title, Essentialism, ALSO begins with an 'E'. And thus, I will base my whole existence on the solemn truth held in it's illustrious pages. Reading this book was like uncovering a religion that I didn't know existed but unknowingly worshipped.
