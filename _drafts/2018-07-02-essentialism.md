## Essentialism
by Greg Mckeown

This blog was conceived while reading this book. Perhaps conceived is too strong a word. I'd like to think of this blog as a direct decendent of the book. Or rather, it tries to be. At the very least, they share similar names so there is that. 

### The Essential Idea
In this age of distraction, learning how to focus on the essential is imperative.

### Key Insights

I rather like the steps Greg lays out to the essential lifestyle: 
1. Explore
1. Eliminate
1. Execute

These 3 steps all start with the letter 'E'. Coincidentally, the book title, Essentialism, ALSO begins with an 'E'. And thus, I will base my whole existence on the solemn truth held in it's illustrious pages. Reading this book was like uncovering a religion that I didn't know existed but unknowingly worshipped.

There are a few topics under each of the 3 E's. My favorite topic in each step is covered below. 

### Explore
Essentialists explore more but commit to less. Essentialists harness the Power of Play - learn and do things for fun. I didn't fully grasp the lesson until I recently read a book on Mongols for fun. This book on the life of Genghis Khan and the hardships he faced and the lessons I learned from the book inspired me at work. Listening to Podcasts like the History of Rome and Philosophize This have provided clarity and allowed me to gather more meaning from my own life. Highly recommend playing around once in a while. 

### Eliminate
Extreme selectivity. If it's not a Hell Yes, it's a No. The idea is you have limited bandwidth every day. I have tried to constrain myself to 1 work priority per day and 1 personal priority to help me toe the line with eliminate. This doesn't mean I can't do anything else. It just means I will hold my self-evaluation purely on completing the main priority for that day. 

### Execute
_Flow or Focus_. There's been a lot of research about getting into the flow state (also discussed in the Now habit). It's an area of interest for me. I'm always happy at the end of the day when I can even spend one hour in the flow state. The key here is getting to the essential thing to focus on right now. If you've got other competing thoughts vying for attention, write them down so you don't forget but switch back to complete focus on the present.
