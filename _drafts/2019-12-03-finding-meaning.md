What makes finding meaning difficult is lack of time freedom. When I am not able to set boundaries and feel multiple pulls on my time, I can't make enough progress on my own individual goals. 

The general principle for gaining time freedom - making enough money (through passive means) and spending as little money as possible can rapidly gain people time freedom. Becoming a Sanyas is just an extreme form of spending as little money as possible and immediately gaining time freedom. Note that time freedom exists on a spectrum and you don't need complete freedom to start your journey on finding meaning, but it definitely helps. 

Finding meaning in one's life is an ancient question, and while there's no roadmap, there are some hints that previous thinkers have left behind. I've found these hints worth thinking about. Note, I'm not a religious person, and these terms are overloaded, but they are full of inherent meaning that it feels incomplete to use any other terms. I think the trifecta of concepts to help us out here are Dharma, Bhakthi and Karma. 

Starting w/ Dharma, the term is super overloaded across multiple religions but the way that's been helpful for me to think about has been the right way for me to live (as opposed to a universal right way to live for all humanity/the universe). Useful artifacts to help here have been Man's Search for Meaning (Viktor E Frankl), The Gita, writings of Thich Nhat Tanh, and Meditations (Marcus Aurelius). That's a scattered bit of reading but there's a ton on the subject. The key is realizing there are many paths available to achieve your personal Dharma. Man's Search for Meaning is the easiest book to start with because the author is clear on the most common ways of finding meaning; through creation (of monuments, artifacts, in general things of value) or through admiration (of nature, humanity, in general things of beauty). 

Next, Bhakthi comes into play. Now, I know this isn't the usual use of Bhakthi but I'm going to put it out there anyway. The Bhakthi I'm talking about is faith that your personal Dharma exists. The faith that your Dharma is out there, somewhere, waiting for discovery. It is the constant light against the void of meaninglessness. Bhakthi is hard to come by and easily forgotten. There's not a lot of additional reading material or tips I can put out there, because it is what it is - Faith. 

Finally, Karma. Once it's clear that there is a path for everyone, the next job is to traverse it via Action (i.e. Karma). There are only 2 possible actions. (1) Finding your Dharma if you don't know it already - through introspection and experiential learning. (2) executing on that Dharma. Action helps provide greater clarity on what the next step towards the right path is and hence the trifecta is complete: Dharma -> Bhakthi -> Karma -> Bhakthi.
