## The Power of Habit
by Charles Duhigg

Habits rule the world. One of my favorite quotes is by Aristotle "You are what you repeatedly do". Granted he would've said that in Latin, but it retains a poetic touch nonetheless. This book has the power to change lives. I myself am excited by it's potential to change my own. It seems to me that these habits - offloading portions of my daily workload to my basal ganglia will prove to be key to a happy and productive life. 

### The Essential Idea 
Habits run the individual, the community, the world. The sooner you learn to carefully curate habits, the happier you can become. 

### Key insights
Cue -> Response -> Reward. This feedback loop guides everything. In fact, it can get so strong that it creates a craving. 
The basic idea of a craving is that the reward response of the brain is triggered even before the ACTUAL reward gets to you. For example, if you've always rewarded yourself with juice every time you walk past your fridge, you will literally feel the reward sensations in your mind every time you walk past the fridge. Later, if you walk past your fridge again without drinking the juice - you'll initially feel the high of the reward but if you don't actually drink the juice, you will feel sad (first signs of craving). 

There is good news however - not only bad things provide rewards. A morning exercise habit can be cultivated by getting your body used to the endorphin rush of working out.
