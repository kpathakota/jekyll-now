## The Cause of dissatisfaction

It's clear from discussions that many people have the following model of dissatisfaction: 

![Cause and effect]({{site.baseurl}}/https://github.com/kpathakota/kpathakota.github.io/blob/master/images/MediatingMind1.PNG)

Here, X is any external force like Alice spilling milk on you or Bob cutting you off in traffic. For an intro to causal diagrams, and a great discussion of causality in general, __The Book of Why__ is a great start. 

I disagree with that model. I think it's missing an important "mediator" effect. That of the Mediating Mind - AKA the self or rational conscience. The model I subscribe to looks more like this: 

Here, M is the "Mediating Mind" and X is any external force like you overhearing Charles tell his friends that you can't cut it at the higher levels of squash. I mean, c'mon Charles! We haven't played in years ... 

In any case, the M is a part of every external interaction we take part of whereas the external force X is variable. For the most part, the source of X is different as well. 

A more extreme version of this is the following, where everything goes through the "M": 

I however, like the flexibility of assigning a direct relationship between external force and internal strife - it feels more consistent with what happens. Perhaps I'm only referring to a more primal element that's more difficult to control (but can still be controlled) or maybe there really is a automatic reaction that's impossible to stop but I think it still exists. In any case, there are a few methods for dealing with dissatisfaction if you subscribe to my model above. 

### Directly confront the cause
