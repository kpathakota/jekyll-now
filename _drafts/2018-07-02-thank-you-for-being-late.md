## Thank you for being late
by Thomas Friedman
Major themes:
* Dislocation of society due to continued acceleration and society not being able to change at the rate that technology is.
* Exponential growth in multiple fields (memory, connectivity, compute power) has caused unheard of growth.
* Holocene period. This is an age of excellent conditions. 
* How can politics change to deal with the age of acceleration. Why has mother earth been so successful? Bio-mimicry. Change through adaptation. Threat of homogenous cultures and advantages of polycultural societies. 


Essential Idea:
* Architect your own house. Empowering the individual.
