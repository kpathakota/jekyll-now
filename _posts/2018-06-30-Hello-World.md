This was a really quick site setup. Thoughts like "Why didn't I ever start a blog" keep me up at night but when you feel like getting it done, it only takes 15 minutes. 

Hopefully this results in me saving time because writing things down helps flush it out of the system and prevent thought spirals. I usually write down notes on papare but on days that are more reactive, I'm unable to do even that. It will be useful to step back and take stock once in a while. This as an outlet. Right now, I will mainly focus on ideas pertaining to the simplification of life - whether it's work or play. Those ideas come from many sources but recently they've been from books I'm reading or listening to so I'll focus on that.
