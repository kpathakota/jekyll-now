## The Mediating Mind 

It's clear from discussions that many people have the following model of dissatisfaction:   

![Cause and effect]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MediatingMind1.PNG) 

Here, X is any external force like Alice spilling milk on you or Bob cutting you off in traffic. Y is the mental angst caused by the event X. The side effects of Y could include increased heart rate, dilated pupils, or perhaps an increased penchance for bitchly-ness. For an intro to causal diagrams, and a great discussion of causality in general, [__The Book of Why__](https://amzn.to/2RoTju2) is a great start.  

I disagree with that model. I think it's missing an important "mediator" effect. That of the Mediating Mind - AKA the self or rational conscience. The model I subscribe to looks more like this:

Here, X is any external force like you overhearing Charles tell his friends that you can't cut it at the higher levels of squash. I mean, c'mon Charles! We haven't played in years, and my backhand has improved immensely. M is the "Mediating Mind" and is responsible for such illustrious actions as calling back to the offending event over and over (was Daisy laughing at ME?), assigning blame to anyone involved and just in general serving as a feedback loop of misery. 

A more extreme version of this is the following, where everything goes through the "M":

This model seems prevalent in Buddhism or the Vedanta, where nearly everything can be controlled by the mind.  

I however, like the flexibility of assigning a direct relationship between external force and internal strife and an indirect relationship via the mind - it feels more consistent with what happens. Perhaps this direct effect refers to a more primal element that's more difficult to control (but can still be tamed) or maybe there really is a automatic reaction that's impossible to stop but I think it still exists. In any case, there are a few methods for dealing with dissatisfaction if you subscribe to the 2nd model above.  

### Directly confront the cause 

In this model, you can confront the external force that is causing you distress like so:

This implies training Alice to never spill milk on you again, or challenging Charles to a 1:1 squash duel (and making sure that the man's confidence is ruined at the end of the match so he can no longer spoil your good name). Every time you experience discomfort, you will be forced to confront the offending cause.

Of course, since you can't tackle the primary cause (no going back in time), you can only tackle the person behind the cause, so your remedy looks more like this:

Phew! That's a lot of work! And it doesnt even guarantee that you'll stop experiencing pain. Another source of disturbance may turn up and you'll have to put in the same amount of work again to prevent them from causing you pain.  
 

### Train the mediating mind 

An alternate model for mitigation is the following:  

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MediatingMind3.PNG)

Here, you train your mind to contribute less of an indirect effect on your mental distress. The beauty of this method is it's the same M in any of the causes to strife (X1...Xn). There are many options to train M - gaining perspective, meditation, improving your ability to empathize with others etc. but in general, by improving your minds ability to deal with a particular scenario (Alice spilling milk on you), it is possible to improve your ability to deal with subsequent difficulties (Charles is at it again!). This compounds over time and it's my belief that it's the key to lowering overall dissatisfaction felt. 

Both models work and can be employed in different circumstances but it's up to you to decide which model to apply more.
